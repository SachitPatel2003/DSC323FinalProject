# DSC323FinalProject

## Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset Project
In this project (assigned as a final for DSC 323: Data Analysis and Regression) I analyzed a dataset regarding Seoul Bike Sharing. Attached in this repositroy is the SAS code script used, the original dataset that was utilized for this analysis, and the final PowerPoint submitted for the project.Additionally, I've created recording over the PowerPoint for easier viewing.

Some work done for this project includes:
- Cleaning the Dataset of outliers and influential points by checking for their studentized residuals.
- Building models and checking various diagnostics for normality assumptions.
- Using model selection to help determine significant and insignificant predictors.
- Detailing the flow of the work and findings in the presentation.
